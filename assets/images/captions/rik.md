Rik Arends is co-founder and CTO of Cloud9 IDE, Inc (previously Ajax.org).
Early to recognise the shift between compiled and dynamic languages, he worked
on language transcompilers, in-browser graphics, optimized API designs, NoSQL
database architecture and high performance webservice driven applications. As
an early believer of the browser as the winning application runtime, Rik
focussed his career on making the web a better place for developers. Rik now
oversees the technical vision and development of Cloud9 IDE.
