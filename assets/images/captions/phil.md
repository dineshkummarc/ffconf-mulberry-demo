Phil is a JavaScript developer who has been developing web applications since
the late 90s. These days, he’s the Technical Director for The Team. The Team is
an agency based in London, he focusses more on technical architecture and
working closely with developers, designers, and UX designers, than writing
code. He loves that role, but just can’t keep his sticky fingers away from
code, which leads him to various small experiments and side projects. In his
previous roles at places like Verisign, VMware and BT, Phil spent much time
espousing the value of adopting unobtrusive JavaScript, Open Web standards and
open source technologies.
